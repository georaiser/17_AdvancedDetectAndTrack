# custom_bytetrack.yaml

tracker_type: bytetrack

# High confidence threshold - when to consider a detection "confirmed"
# Lower for license plates since vehicles can have varying detection confidence
track_high_thresh: 0.4

# Low confidence threshold - minimum to keep existing tracks alive
# Keep default - vehicles below this are likely false positives
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# New track threshold - when to start a new track
# Lower for vehicles that might initially have lower confidence
new_track_thresh: 0.4

# Track buffer - frames to keep a track alive after losing detection
# Higher for license plates - vehicles can be temporarily occluded
track_buffer: 50

# Match threshold - IoU threshold for matching detections to existing tracks
# Lower for vehicles that can change appearance (different angles, lighting)
match_thresh: 0.7

# Fuse score - whether to use detection score + tracking score
# False for cleaner tracking, especially when vehicle confidence varies
fuse_score: false

# Additional parameters (if supported)
# Track activation threshold - detections needed before track is "activated"
min_box_area: 100      # Minimum bounding box area (filters tiny detections)
aspect_ratio_thresh: 1.6  # Filter non-vehicle aspect ratios
